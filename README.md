# Spring Boot Demo

Implementation of Spring Boot projects while learning the Spring framework as
part of the Udemy course **\[NEW\] Master Spring Boot 3 & Spring Framework 6
with Java**

## Information

Edit `settings.gradle.kts` to select the project that will be run with `gradle
bootRun`. Don't forget to comment and uncomment the `@SpringBootApplication`
annotation so that there is one active project.

The commits snapshot the state of the project up to the end of course sections.
